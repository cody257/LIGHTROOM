# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation. **This repo is single-context:** one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/` at the root.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the domain glossary.
- **`docs/adr/`** — the ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If these files don't exist yet, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily, when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-<decision>.md
│   └── 0002-<decision>.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider), or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…_
